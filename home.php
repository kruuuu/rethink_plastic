        Welcome!
        Everyday we use plastic in some or the othr form because of its advantages we unsee the harmful effect it causes when disposed in improper way. 
        Because plastic is in our daily routine from get up until we sleep so it is near to impossible to remove plastic from use. Banning plastic product is not a complete practical solution as it has served many beneficial uses as it gives a roof for poor, for people who cant afford high price shoe it gives them a cheaper option.
        BUT TODAY, we came up here with a solution that though we cant unuse plastic but we can convert the waste into a useful product and so we are here with few organisations that do such work. Through this website it will become easy for you to find such organisations and contact them to reach out!!
